# Climate Desk
This is a side project that offers an easy to navigate dashboard for climate
products. Right now it displays pre-prepared images with the ability to complement
with discussion text.

For me this is just an exploration of Tkinter and GUI applications, but it also
seems to do a good job of aggregating somewhat difficult to find climate products.

Once the core goals are met, I'd like to add basic data display capabilities for
various indices. Don't worry, I also want to explore packaging through this project! So eventually I want to offer regular installers for everyone's favorite OS (this should be cross platform compatible. I've used it on Ubuntu and Windows 10 so far)
