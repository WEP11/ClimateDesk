# ClimateDesk
This is a side project that offers an easy to navigate dashboard for climate
products. Right now it displays pre-prepared images with the ability to complement
with discussion text.

For me this is just an exploration of Tkinter and GUI applications, but it also
seems to do a good job of aggregating somewhat difficult to find climate products.

Once the core goals are met, I'd like to add basic data display capabilities for
various indices.
