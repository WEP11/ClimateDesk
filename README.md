# Climate Desk
This is a side project that offers an easy to navigate dashboard for various climate
products (Mainly from CPC). Right now it displays pre-prepared images with the ability to display
discussion text in a separate window.

Checkout the [releases](https://github.com/WEP11/ClimateDesk/releases) page for the latest working version!

For me this is mainly just an exploration of Tkinter and GUI applications, but it also
seems to do an okay job of aggregating somewhat difficult to find climate products.
